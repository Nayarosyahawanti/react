      description: `The original 550 debuted in 1989 and made its mark on basketball courts from side to side. After its initial launch, the 550 was tucked away in the archives, before being reintroduced in a limited edition release in late 2020, and returning to the full-time lineup in 2021, quickly becoming a global fashion favourite. The familiar 550 silhouette is complemented by a premium leather upper, presented in a monochromatic colorway, for an attractive classic look.`,

      description: `The designers of the first 990 were tasked with creating the best running shoe on the market. The MADE in USA 990v6 takes on authentic credentials, with a number of updates inspired by its performance. The upper circulates air thanks to a midfoot saddle, allowing the suede and synthetic overlays to channel air from heel to toe through the mesh underlay, for a fast, sleek look. The evolved design is one of the most dramatic changes from one model generation to the next ever seen on the 990, the biggest change being on the inside. The addition of midsole cushioning means the evolution of the 990 can be felt as well as seen.`,
